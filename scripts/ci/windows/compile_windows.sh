# Jenkins is capable of executing shell scripts directly, even on Windows,
# but it uses a shell binary bundled with it and not the msys one. We don't
# want to use two different shells, so a batch file is used instead to call
# the msys shell.

# We need to execute bash with -l so that we don't get the usual environment
# variables from cmd.exe which would interfere with our operation, but that
# means that PWD will be $HOME. Thus, we need to cd to the source tree.
